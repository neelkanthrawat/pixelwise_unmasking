    "2. Add the procedural pixel selection/ unmasking thing. The idea is:\n",
    "    * Generate all the pixels, accept only a few of them and then reject the other ones and then resample the remaining portion of the image again.\n",

    "1. In the current architecture by the previous student, the dimension of the latent space is same as that of the original data space.\n",
    "    * The current code also something like: `torch.linalg.slogdet` and maybe that is suppose to be square? I need to look into this thingy and generalise the code. the current architecture is extremely restrictive\n",
    "        * Task to do: fix this -ish. Make the code as general as possible. and then  for the use case, one can set the latent dimension to be same as the input dimension. "
